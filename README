Ella
==========

*This is fork, not the original thing - go to github.com/ella/ella for it*

While I'd love this fork to cease, there are hardcore fixes for things not configurable in
original Ella. Use at own risk.


Ella is opensource CMS based on Django framework,
designed for flexibility.

Althrough code is now used in production, we're now
still in pre-release stage. Feel free to play with code,
but do not expect it to be supported for production.

We'll be heading there soon.

Main repository lives in http://github.com/ella/ella/tree/master
You can also track us on ohloh at https://www.ohloh.net/p/ella-cms

Support is reachable in mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/ella-project

Bugtracker and friends will be available later.
